## About
I am an engineer, scientific modeler, and CEO of [M3 Works](m3works.io).
M3 Works are the architects of modern iSnobal, and in that role I focus
on developing the next generation of physically based snow-water resource tools.
Through that mission, I also support a number of opensource code-sets for
the cryosphere and geoscience community.

More info on M3 Works and iSnobal can be 
found [here](https://m3works.io/#/why-we-chose-isnobal).
